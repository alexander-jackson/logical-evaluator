# Logical Evaluator

Logical Evaluator (LE) is a Rust tool for evaluating logical expressions in
different ways.

## Installation

You can install LE by cloning the Git repository, and then using Rust's package
manager Cargo to build the executable.

```
git clone https://github.com/alexander-jackson/logical-evaluator.git
cd logical-evaluator/
cargo build
```

## Usage

While in the `logical-evaluator` repository, you can type the following to get
documentation.

```
cargo run -- -h

Evaluates logical expressions and displays truth tables

USAGE:
    le [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --formula <WFF>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help           Prints help information
        --truth_table    Informs the program to display a truth table for the WFF
    -V, --version        Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -f, --formula <WFF>            Sets the formula to act on
        --valuation <VARIABLES>    Sets the variables that are true in the formula
```

A simple test to ensure it build properly is to do
`cargo run -- --formula 'a&b' --truth_table` to get the truth table for
`A âˆ§ B`.
